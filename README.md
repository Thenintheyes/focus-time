# Focus Time

A minimalist, high-precision time management tool designed for deep work sessions. It features a Clock, Countdown Timer, and Stopwatch in a distraction-free, full-screen interface.

🌟 Features
----

Triple Mode: Seamlessly switch between Clock, Timer, and Stopwatch.

Atomic Precision: Automatically syncs with internet time (worldtimeapi.org) to correct local system clock drift and latency.

Immersive Design: Deep black background with crisp white typography to reduce eye strain.

Focus Mode: Press F to hide all UI elements, leaving only the numbers for zero distractions.

Custom Typography: Choose from over 20+ curated fonts (including Inter, Unbounded, Poppins, and Digital) to match your aesthetic.

Smart Controls:

Spacebar: Start/Pause Timer or Stopwatch.

Tabular Numbers: Prevents "jittering" as digits change width.
